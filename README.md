### Project Description
A dating app for animals where pets can swipe, match, and chat with each other. Because apparently animals need love too, and humans weren't enough!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Animals are lonely! Your pet dog is tired of the same boring walks and wants to find romance. Your cat needs someone to ignore together. Zoo animals are stuck in their enclosures with no way to find their soulmate from the penguin exhibit next door.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
TindrZoo Xtreme - the ultimate animal dating platform! Create profiles for your pets, swipe through potential matches based on habitat compatibility, send interests, and let your furry (or feathery, or scaly) friends find true love. Complete with chat system, match notifications, and even a gossip ticker for the latest zoo drama!
